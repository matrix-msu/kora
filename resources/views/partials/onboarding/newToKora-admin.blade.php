            <h3>Let's go over the basics.</h3>
            <p>kora is an open-source, database-driven, online digital repository application for complex digital objects. These objects include: text, document files, images, audio, video, 3d models, or geolocations. <span class="bold">kora allows you to store, manage, and publish these digital objects, each with corresponding metadata in a single record,</span> allowing them to be searchable, and viewable on a public facing website.</p>

            <h3>Digital Object + Metadata = A Record</h3>
            <p>kora allows you to upload your digital objects along with corresponding metadata into a single "record".  <span class="bold">This record contains the digital object itself, along with descriptive information about the object (metadata), such as its author, where it was found, and its current location.</span>  With according metadata, your objects become a digital repository that is searchable and publishable.</p>

            <h3>A record is created using a form.</h3>
            <p><span class="bold">A Form is a group of customizable fields that you use to create metadata for your objects.</span>  When you create a new record, you fill out a form.  A project can have multiple forms depending on the types of objects you're storing or the audiences you're targeting.  You might have, for instance, one form for photographs and another form for essays that contextualize those photograph objects.</p>
